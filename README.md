# funsocks

Had a little fun with TCP and HTTP, then built a TCP proxy from scratch.

Very few lines of code!

## In your browser:

Visit `localhost:8008` for the TCP server (with emulated HTTP response)

Visit `localhost:8118` for the HTTP server built with Node's HTTP library.

Visit `localhost:8228` for the TCP proxy. You will see response from `localhost:8118`.
